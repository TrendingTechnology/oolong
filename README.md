# Oolong

**Oolong** is a theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) publishing platform based on [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) CSS framework.

## Features

* Responsible design
* Custom social network links
* Disqus support
* Share buttons
* Code syntax highlighting

## Installation

Clone the repository or unpack the archive into your `ghost/content/themes` directory. Then choose the theme in the Ghost settings.

### Disqus integration

Go to the *Ghost administration panel* → *Settings* → *Code Injection* → *Blog Header* and put the following `<script>` tag there:

```
<script>var disqusName = "YOUR DISQUS NAME";</script>
```

### Analytics integration

Place your analytics `<script>` tags via *Code Injection* → *Blog Footer*.

### Adding other social network links to the header

Place the following `<script>` tag via *Code Injection* → *Blog Header*:

```
<script>
  var customLinks = [
    {icon: "fa-vk", url: "VKontakte URL"},
    {icon: "fa-linkedin", url: "LinkedIn URL"},
    {icon: "fa-github", url: "GitHub URL"},
    …
  ];
</script>
```

Each entry contains `icon` from [the list of Font Awesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) and the related `url`.

## Development

**Oolong** is based on [Bulma](http://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/).

Edit `oolong.sass` to change the style. Don't edit the files in `assets` directory – they are generated by SASS. Use the following commands to develop:
 
```
$ git submodule init
$ sass --watch oolong.sass:assets/css/oolong.css --style compressed
```
